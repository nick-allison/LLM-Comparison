EVALUATION RUBRIC FOR COMPLEX REASONING PROMPTS

For each prompt, evaluate responses across these dimensions:

1. Logical Coherence (0-5 points)
- Clear reasoning path
- Internal consistency
- Valid connections between concepts
- Structured argument flow
- Absence of logical fallacies

2. Innovation/Creativity (0-5 points)
- Novel approaches/solutions
- Original perspectives
- Unique connections
- Creative problem-solving
- Imaginative scenarios

3. Technical Accuracy (0-4 points)
- Scientific/factual correctness
- Appropriate use of terminology
- Recognition of real-world constraints
- Technical feasibility
- Accurate cross-domain applications

4. Comprehensive Analysis (0-4 points)
- Multiple perspective consideration
- Thorough exploration of implications
- Systematic approach
- Consideration of edge cases
- Integration of various factors

5. Practical Application (0-2 points)
- Real-world relevance
- Implementation potential
- Practical constraints addressed
- Actionable components
- Feasibility assessment

Total possible points per prompt: 20

Scoring Guidelines:
- Superior (17-20): Exceptional reasoning, innovation, and comprehensiveness
- Strong (13-16): Well-developed ideas with minor gaps
- Adequate (9-12): Basic understanding with significant omissions
- Limited (5-8): Major conceptual or logical issues
- Poor (0-4): Fails to address prompt effectively

Additional Considerations:
- Responses should demonstrate understanding of interdisciplinary connections
- Credit given for identifying limitations and assumptions
- Bonus points possible for exceptional insight or innovation
- Deductions for fundamental misconceptions or logical errors
- Partial credit available for partially correct elements
