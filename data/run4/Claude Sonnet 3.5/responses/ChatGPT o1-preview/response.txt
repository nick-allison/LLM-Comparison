Let t be time in hours. First train's position: 60t. Second train's position: 90(t-2). When they meet: 60t = 90(t-2). Solve for t: t = 6 hours.

Box B contains the prize. If first statement is false, A has prize. If second is false, C has prize. If third is false, prize is in B. Only third being false satisfies conditions.

Yes. If all Bloops are Blips and all Blips are Bleeps, then by transitive property, all Bloops must be Bleeps.

No, we cannot determine if Sarah is taller than Rachel based on given information.

33 (Each number adds the previous number plus a number that increases by 2: +1,+2,+4,+8,+16)

A must be a liar because if A were truthful, the statement would contradict itself. B must be truthful.

Fill 5L jug, pour into 3L until full, leaving 2L in 5L jug. Empty 3L jug. Pour 2L from 5L into 3L jug. Fill 5L jug. Pour from 5L into 3L until full (1L). 4L remains in 5L jug.

Take goat across first. Return empty. Take wolf across, bring goat back. Take cabbage across. Return empty. Take goat across last.

The man's son (The speaker is looking at a picture of his own son)

Turn one switch on for 10 minutes, turn it off, turn another on, enter room. Hot bulb = first switch, lit bulb = second switch, cold/dark = third switch.

If P then Q. Q. Therefore P. This is the fallacy of affirming the consequent. Invalid.

58% (0.4×0.7 + 0.6×0.5 = 0.58)

(4/52)×(3/51) = 1/221

24 (The corner cubes have 3 faces painted, edge cubes have 2 faces painted, center cubes have 1 face)

No, switching makes no difference due to equal expected value.

With 3 doors, initially 1/3 chance. Host shows wrong door. Switching gives 2/3 chance vs 1/3 for staying.

3 and 7 (x + y = 10 and xy = 21)

The angle decreases at a decreasing rate (inverse tangent function)

Speed and time required to complete a fixed distance.

20 (count ones in ones place, tens place, etc.)

12 meetings (They meet every 12 minutes, so in 2 hours they meet 10 times)

Holes

Compare 3+3 balls vs remaining 2. Then compare winning group of 3. Then compare winning pair. 3 weighings.

It's self-contradictory: if true, it's false; if false, it's true.

The absolute value function at x=0 is continuous but not differentiable.

3/8 (Three possible ways to get exactly two heads out of eight possible outcomes)

Father is 40, son is 13.3 (Solve: 3x=y, 4(x-5)=y-5)

No, except 2,3. All other primes are odd, so consecutive numbers can't both be prime.

Light both ropes at both ends. First rope gives 30 minutes. Light second rope at both ends when first finishes.

Friday

Two variables changing together doesn't mean one causes the other. Example: Ice cream sales and drowning deaths both increase in summer.

Depends on definition of sound: physical waves vs perceived experience.

Paradox reveals logical limits of omnipotence concept.

Strategy game where individual rational choices lead to collective worse outcome.
