Rolle's Theorem states that if a function is continuous on [a, b], differentiable on (a, b), and f(a) = f(b), then there exists at least one c in (a, b) such that f'(c) = 0. This is because to go from f(a) back to f(b) at the same height, the function must turn around at some point, which implies a zero derivative.
