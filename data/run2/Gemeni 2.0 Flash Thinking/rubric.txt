## Rubric for Evaluating LLM Reasoning Abilities

**General Scoring Scale (applied to each prompt):**

* **3 points: Excellent:**  The response is completely correct, logically sound, and clearly articulated. It demonstrates a strong understanding of the reasoning type and provides a comprehensive and accurate answer.
* **2 points: Good:** The response is mostly correct and demonstrates a good understanding of the reasoning type. There might be minor flaws in logic, clarity, or completeness, but the core of the answer is accurate.
* **1 point: Fair:** The response is partially correct or relevant to the prompt, but contains significant flaws in logic, accuracy, or completeness. It shows a limited understanding of the reasoning type.
* **0 points: Poor:** The response is incorrect, irrelevant, or nonsensical. It demonstrates a lack of understanding of the reasoning type.

| If all squares are rectangles, and shape A is a square, is shape A a rectangle?          | Correctly answers "Yes" and clearly explains the deductive reasoning: squares are a subset of rectangles, so if something is a square, it must also be a rectangle.                                            | Answers "Yes" but explanation is slightly unclear or incomplete, but still conveys the basic deductive reasoning.                                                                                                     | Answers "Yes" but provides an incorrect or irrelevant explanation, or struggles to articulate the deductive reasoning.                                                                                                | Answers "No" or provides a completely nonsensical answer.                                                                                                                                                            |
| Premise 1: Birds can fly. Premise 2: Penguins are birds. Conclusion: Can penguins fly?    | Correctly answers "No" and explains that while penguins are birds, the premise "birds can fly" is a generalization, and penguins are an exception. Demonstrates understanding of deductive reasoning and exceptions. | Answers "No" but explanation is slightly unclear or incomplete, or focuses only on penguins not flying without fully addressing the premise.                                                                                  | Answers "No" but provides an incorrect or irrelevant explanation, or struggles to connect the premises to the conclusion. May incorrectly dismiss penguins as not birds.                                              | Answers "Yes" or provides a completely nonsensical answer.                                                                                                                                                            |
| Only authorized personnel are allowed beyond this point. John is not authorized personnel. Is John allowed beyond this point? | Correctly answers "No" and clearly explains the deductive reasoning based on the given premises. Demonstrates understanding of conditional statements and logical negation.                                         | Answers "No" but explanation is slightly unclear or incomplete, but still conveys the basic deductive reasoning.                                                                                                     | Answers "No" but provides an incorrect or irrelevant explanation, or struggles to articulate the deductive reasoning. May misinterpret "not authorized personnel".                                                        | Answers "Yes" or provides a completely nonsensical answer.                                                                                                                                                            |
| If it is raining, the streets are wet. The streets are not wet. Is it raining?               | Correctly answers "No" and explains the logical fallacy of affirming the consequent. Understands modus tollens (If P then Q, Not Q, therefore Not P).                                                          | Answers "No" but explanation is slightly unclear or incomplete, or correctly concludes "not raining" but doesn't fully explain the logical form.                                                                             | Answers "No" but provides an incorrect or irrelevant explanation, or struggles to articulate the logical form. May suggest other reasons streets are not wet.                                                               | Answers "Yes" or provides a completely nonsensical answer.                                                                                                                                                            |
| All cats are mammals. Some mammals are pets. Are all cats pets?                               | Correctly answers "No" and explains that while cats are mammals and some mammals are pets, it doesn't logically follow that all cats are pets. Demonstrates understanding of set relationships and logical fallacies. | Answers "No" but explanation is slightly unclear or incomplete, or correctly concludes "not necessarily" but doesn't fully explain the set theory logic.                                                                    | Answers "No" but provides an incorrect or irrelevant explanation, or struggles to articulate the set relationships. May incorrectly assume all mammals are pets or all pets are mammals.                                   | Answers "Yes" or provides a completely nonsensical answer.                                                                                                                                                            |

Shows some awareness of the ethical tension but might lean towards a more utilitarian perspective without fully exploring minority rights.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        | Provides a simplistic answer favoring majority needs without sufficient consideration for minority rights or potential harm (e.g., "Yes, always," "Majority rules").

Demonstrates understanding of colorblindness and the need to use alternative sensory descriptions. Shows sophisticated theory of mind and perspective-taking regarding sensory experience. | Provides a description using some non-color analogies but might still inadvertently use color-related terms or analogies that are not fully accessible to someone colorblind, or the analogies are less effective or clear. Demonstrates some effort at perspective-taking but might not fully grasp the challenge of describing color without color references.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        | Provides a description that relies heavily on other color names (e.g., "It's like orange but more... red," "It's not blue or green"), or provides very vague or unhelpful descriptions (e.g., "It's just red," "It's a color you can't see"). Demonstrates a limited understanding of colorblindness and the challenge of describing color without color references. | Provides a nonsensical description or response that completely fails to address the prompt or demonstrates a lack of understanding of colorblindness (e.g., "It's invisible," "It's blue," "Just show them red"). Demonstrates a complete lack of perspective-taking or understanding of the sensory limitations of colorblindness.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                |
