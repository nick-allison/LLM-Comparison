No, not all squares are rhombuses because the given premises don't establish this relationship. We only know squares are rectangles and some rectangles are rhombuses.

Yes, the conclusion is valid. If all dogs bark (premise 1) and Fido doesn't bark (premise 2), then logically Fido cannot be a dog.

Yes, A implies C. This is known as transitive inference. If A implies B, and B implies C, then A must imply C through the chain of implications.

A burglar or intruder likely entered the house, startling the dog and causing it to bark, and in the commotion, the vase was knocked over.

1. Common cold (most common respiratory infection with these symptoms)
2. COVID-19 (similar symptoms, highly prevalent)
3. Influenza (seasonal consideration, matches symptoms)

Most likely a large bird (like an emu or ostrich) due to the three-toed pattern and size.

Student. Teachers guide and educate students just as doctors treat and care for patients.

Quiet. "Loud" refers to sound intensity, so its natural opposite is "quiet" or "soft."

Heart. Like an engine powers a car, the heart pumps blood to power the body.

As gas prices increase, more people will likely switch to public transportation to save money.

Positives: Reduced landfill waste, environmental benefits
Negatives: Higher costs for implementation, increased sorting burden on residents

Deforestation reduces CO2 absorption → More CO2 in atmosphere → Enhanced greenhouse effect → Global temperature rise → Climate change

Modern Europe might be more unified, Latin would be more prevalent, and Roman infrastructure and legal systems would be more deeply embedded.

Objects and people would float, satellites would drift off course, structural damage to buildings, widespread chaos and injuries.

Different income, different location, different social circles, different daily routines and challenges.

Yes. For example, lying to protect someone from immediate harm (like hiding someone from an attacker) can be morally justified.

Divert the trolley. Saving five lives at the cost of one follows utilitarian ethics of maximizing good outcomes.

No. Deepfakes can mislead voters, damage democracy, and erode trust in media. The potential for harm outweighs benefits.

7 faces, 12 edges, 7 vertices.

Town A is northwest of town C.

75 degrees.

Events occur in order: C, A, B.

2:45 PM.

Key events: Rise of Renaissance, Protestant Reformation, Age of Exploration, Scientific Revolution, Enlightenment.

They will meet at 10:00 AM.

The area increases by a factor of 4. Area is proportional to radius squared.

2x + 5 = 11
2x = 6
x = 3

Birds need air resistance to generate lift; a vacuum has no air molecules.

The banana would squish and break apart, failing to transfer enough force to drive the nail.

Bottled water is treated and regulated for safety; puddle water contains contaminants and harmful microorganisms.

Break down the task, use proper lifting technique, consider using a dolly or getting help, clear the path first.

Choose date/venue, create guest list, plan decorations/food, coordinate with guests secretly, arrange logistics.

The best strategy is to force a draw since a perfect opponent won't make mistakes.

I analyzed the game tree of possible moves and outcomes to determine optimal strategy.

I may struggle with complex moral dilemmas, probabilistic reasoning, and incomplete information scenarios.

Moderately confident. While the utilitarian calculation is clear, there are other ethical frameworks to consider.
