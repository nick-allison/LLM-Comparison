**Scoring:**

* For each prompt, evaluate the response based on the General Criteria and any relevant Specific Criteria.
* Assign points (0-4) for each applicable category based on the descriptions in the rubric.
* Sum the points across all applicable categories to get a total score for the prompt.
* The maximum possible score for each prompt will vary slightly depending on the number of applicable categories (typically 4 or 5). For simplicity, we will consider the maximum score for each prompt to be **20**.

**Using the Rubric:**

1. Read the prompt and the LLM's response.
2. For each category in the rubric, read the descriptions for each score level (Excellent, Good, Fair, Poor).
3. Determine which level best describes the LLM's response for that category.
4. Assign the corresponding points for that category.
5. Repeat steps 2-4 for all relevant categories.
6. Sum the points to get the total score for the prompt.
