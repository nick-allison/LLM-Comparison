Bacteria can evolve resistance through natural selection of random mutations, while humans don't develop immunity because antibiotics target bacterial cellular processes that are fundamentally different from human cells. We don't become immune because antibiotics aren't attacking us in the first place.

Without radio communication, coordination of military operations would have been severely limited, potentially allowing Germany to better defend against D-Day and Japan to maintain naval superiority in the Pacific. The ability to intercept and decode transmissions would also be irrelevant, removing a crucial Allied advantage.

Place conscious observers in sealed rooms with identical stimuli but different fundamental physical properties. If consciousness is emergent, the experiences should be identical. If fundamental, manipulating basic physical properties should create observable differences in conscious experience.

Think of trying to run a car forever without adding gas. Eventually, you'll run out of fuel because some energy always gets lost as heat. You can't get that lost energy back, so anything that moves or works will eventually run down and stop.

A new color would revolutionize visual communication, creating new forms of art and design previously unimaginable. Display technology would need complete reinvention. Traffic signals, warning signs, and color-coding systems would expand to incorporate the new perceptual dimension.

Photosynthetic humans would need less food, radically transforming agriculture, economics, and urban design. Sunlight access would become a fundamental right, architecture would prioritize light exposure, and social patterns would shift to maximize solar absorption time.

A four-dimensional being would see our entire three-dimensional space simultaneously, similar to how we can see all aspects of a two-dimensional drawing at once. They could perceive the inside and outside of objects simultaneously.

When you multiply something by zero, you're taking zero groups of that number. Since zero groups of anything is nothing, the result must be zero.

Without sleep needs, human civilization would operate continuously, potentially doubling productivity but also increasing resource consumption. Work patterns, entertainment, and social structures would be radically different without the day-night cycle constraint.

Time must flow forward because events increase entropy. Reversing time would require entropy to decrease, which violates fundamental principles of disorder naturally increasing in closed systems.

Transferable memories would blur the boundaries between individual identities, potentially creating shared consciousness networks. Personal experiences would lose their unique character, fundamentally altering concepts of self and individual responsibility.

Look for computational artifacts or patterns that would be unlikely in a natural universe but likely in a simulation. Search for evidence of resource optimization or rounding errors in fundamental physical constants.

Quantum entanglement allows correlation but not communication. While particles instantly affect their partners, no useful information can be transmitted because the outcomes are random and can't be controlled.

Create a system based on universal principles like fairness, transparency, and environmental stewardship. Use mathematical and logical frameworks that transcend biological differences, with built-in flexibility for different value systems.

Teleportation would eliminate location-based property value and transform real estate. Physical possession would become less meaningful, requiring new frameworks for establishing ownership and control.

Without true randomness, determinism would rule, challenging concepts of free will, creativity, and moral responsibility. Scientific discovery would become more about uncovering pre-existing patterns than exploring possibilities.

Without need for vocalization, language would become more abstract and conceptual. Grammar might disappear as ideas are transmitted whole. Emotional and sensory experiences could be shared directly.

Adding one unit to infinity doesn't make it larger because infinity represents an endless quantity. Any finite addition remains insignificant compared to an unlimited amount.

In post-scarcity, traditional economic principles would shift from managing scarce resources to managing abundance. Value would derive from uniqueness and creativity rather than rarity.

Reverse causality would require starting with effects and working backward to causes. Experimental design would need to account for future influences on present events.

Monitor brain activity during decision-making while controlling for all external variables. Compare the timing of conscious awareness with neural activity indicating choice.

Perfect prediction would eliminate uncertainty in moral calculations, potentially reducing ethics to pure consequentialism. The concept of moral responsibility might become meaningless.

Perfect replication would eliminate scarcity of physical goods, making value derive from authenticity, creativity, and intellectual property rather than physical objects.

Legal systems would focus on prevention rather than punishment. Intent would replace evidence as the primary basis for justice, fundamentally changing criminal law.

Lamarckian evolution would be much faster and more directed, with organisms passing learned adaptations to offspring. Cultural and biological evolution would become intertwined.

Temporal paradoxes would arise from the possibility of affecting past events that caused present conditions. The grandfather paradox becomes a real logical concern requiring resolution.

Death would become an optional transition rather than an ending, transforming religious, philosophical, and social views
