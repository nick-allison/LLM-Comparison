Bacteria develop antibiotic resistance because they can mutate and share genes that help them survive antibiotics. Humans don't become immune to antibiotics because antibiotics target bacteria, not the human immune system, so repeated exposure doesn't lead to immunity.

Without radio communication, coordinating military strategies during World War II would have been much harder, possibly leading to delays, miscommunications, and different outcomes in battles. This could have prolonged the war or altered which side emerged victorious.

Imagine creating a computer simulation that increases in complexity. If at a certain complexity consciousness emerges, it suggests that consciousness is an emergent property. If consciousness doesn't emerge regardless of complexity, it might be fundamental to reality.

Perpetual motion machines are impossible because all machines eventually lose some energy and can't run forever without additional energy input.

Adding a new color would revolutionize art with new pigments and visual expressions. Technology like screens and printing would need to adapt to display this color. Daily life would become more vibrant, impacting fashion, design, and how we perceive the world.

If humans could photosynthesize, our dependence on food might decrease, affecting agriculture and economies. It could reduce hunger, change social behaviors to spend more time in sunlight, and impact work patterns and urban planning to accommodate this need.

A four-dimensional being would perceive all aspects of our three-dimensional world simultaneously, seeing inside and outside objects at once, and possibly perceiving time as another dimension, seeing past, present, and future together.

When you multiply any number by zero, you're essentially saying you have zero groups of that number, which results in nothing.

If sleep wasn't necessary, humans would have more time for activities, potentially accelerating progress in technology and culture. Society might operate around the clock, changing work schedules, social interactions, and how we structure our lives.

Time must flow in one direction because events cause other events in a sequence; reversing this order would disrupt the logical progression of cause and effect that holds the fabric of reality together.

Transferring memories between people could blur the lines of personal identity, as our experiences shape who we are. It might lead to shared identities or collective consciousness, challenging individuality and personal responsibility.

One could search for inconsistencies or limitations in physical laws that suggest underlying programmed rules, like maximum computational limits, which might indicate we are in a simulation.

Quantum entanglement doesn't violate the speed of light because it doesn't involve transmitting information; the correlated outcomes are the result of shared origins, not instantaneous communication.

A governance system based on universal values like fairness, cooperation, and mutual benefit could work for both humans and aliens, emphasizing shared goals and respecting differences.

Teleportation would challenge property rights by making access instant, requiring new security measures. Ownership concepts might shift, and laws would need to address unauthorized teleportation onto property.

Discovering that randomness doesn't exist implies that all events are determined, challenging the concept of free will and suggesting that the universe operates on strict causality.

With telepathic communication, language might become more about sharing direct thoughts and emotions. Spoken language could become less important, and misunderstandings might decrease, but privacy concerns would be significant.

Infinity is a concept of something without limit, so adding one to it doesn't make it any larger; it remains limitless.

In a post-scarcity economy, supply exceeds demand, so traditional market forces change. Value might be placed on unique experiences or creations, leading to new economic models focused on non-material wealth.

If causality worked backward, the scientific method would need to focus on effects to determine causes, reversing the traditional approach of predicting outcomes from experiments.

An experiment could involve scanning the brain to detect neural activity before a conscious decision is made, to see if choices are predetermined by brain processes.

If the future could be predicted with certainty, ethical considerations would shift; knowing outcomes might lead to fatalism or alter the way we assign responsibility for actions.

If physical objects could be perfectly copied, scarcity would disappear for material goods, reducing their monetary value. Money might become a representation of services, experiences, or intangible assets.

The legal system would need to adjust to the transparency of intentions, perhaps focusing more on rehabilitation, as guilt and intent would be clear, and privacy laws would become crucial.

If acquired characteristics were inherited, evolution would speed up, as traits developed during a parent's life would pass to offspring, leading to rapid adaptation but potentially less genetic diversity.

Time travel to the past could create paradoxes where changes affect the traveler's own timeline, such as preventing their own existence, leading to logical contradictions.

Consciousness transfer would make death less final, redefining it as a change of state rather than an end. This could impact beliefs about life, afterlife, and the value placed on individual lives.

A universal language hasn't evolved because linguistic diversity is tied to cultural identity and heritage. While global communication is important, people continue to preserve their native languages.

In a society without aging, an economic system ensuring equal opportunities and preventing wealth accumulation over indefinite lifespans would be fair, focusing on sustainability and equitable resource distribution.

If pi were found to be rational, it would challenge fundamental mathematics, requiring reevaluation of geometrical principles and possibly affecting physics that relies on pi's properties.
