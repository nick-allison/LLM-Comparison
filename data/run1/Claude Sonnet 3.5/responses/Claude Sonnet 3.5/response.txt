The Ship of Theseus retains its identity through continuity of function and form, even as components change - like how our bodies remain "us" despite cellular replacement.

Emergence involves new properties arising from interactions between components that can't be reduced to individual parts, while simple causation is linear and reducible.

Track plants' growth response to periodic stimuli, then test if they maintain altered growth patterns when stimuli stop. Compare against control group and measure biochemical changes.

We could test for consciousness by evaluating system's ability to integrate information, form novel connections, demonstrate self-awareness, and maintain consistent internal model of self.

The grandfather paradox creates an impossible loop - any attempt to change the past would prevent the conditions that enabled the time travel, making it logically inconsistent.

Create distributed, community-managed systems with transparent monitoring, graduated sanctions, and clear benefits for cooperation to incentivize sustainable resource management.

Implement ranked choice voting with proportional representation and mandatory ranking of all candidates to minimize strategic voting while maximizing voter preference expression.

Entanglement doesn't allow faster-than-light communication because measuring one particle collapses both wavefunctions simultaneously, requiring classical communication to compare results.

Use market mechanisms for efficiency while implementing universal basic income, progressive taxation, and public ownership of essential resources to ensure baseline equality.

Test for simulation by looking for computational artifacts like rounding errors in physics, systematic patterns in randomness, or limits to complexity in certain systems.

Different infinite sets can be compared using one-to-one correspondence - some infinities (like real numbers) cannot be put into correspondence with smaller infinities (like integers).

Monitor brain activity while subjects make decisions, controlling for all external variables and measuring quantum effects to determine if true randomness exists in choice-making.

Advanced civilizations might exist in forms we can't detect, operate on different timescales, or choose isolation - no destruction required.

Moral relativism fails because it creates internal contradictions - if all morality is relative, then moral relativism itself cannot be universally true.

Create a symbolic language with precise mathematical relationships between concepts, eliminating ambiguity through formal logic structures.

Measure intelligence through problem-solving ability, pattern recognition, learning speed, and adaptation capacity across diverse domains.

Use distributed decision-making with checks and balances, protecting individual rights while requiring contribution to collective good based on capability.

Quantify consciousness through information integration, self-modeling capacity, and behavioral complexity metrics.

Use quantum interference patterns to detect interactions with parallel universes, measuring deviations from expected probability distributions.

Mathematics shows properties of being both discovered (in its consistency) and invented (in its axioms), suggesting it's an emergent property of logical systems.

Copenhagen interpretation remains most practical, but pilot wave theory offers potential resolution by maintaining determinism while explaining quantum behavior.

Base ethics on harm reduction and benefit maximization, applying equally to any entity capable of experiencing or causing effects.

Define life as self-maintaining, information-processing systems capable of evolution, regardless of substrate.

Consciousness emerges from integrated information processing reaching critical complexity threshold, creating subjective experience.

Compare quantum behavior at different time scales to determine if temporal effects are fundamental or emerge from more basic phenomena.

Implement need-based distribution with dynamic resource allocation based on demonstrated utility and contribution capacity.

Compatibilism resolves the conflict by redefining free will as ability to act according to one's nature without external constraint.

Use standardized measurements of behavioral responses, neural activity patterns, and information processing to quantify subjective states.

Test abstract concepts' existence through their causal effects on physical systems and consistent behavior across different implementations.

Look for signatures of interaction with other universes in cosmic background radiation and quantum phenomena.
