Identity persists through gradual replacement of components based on continuity of function and narrative, not material constitution.
Emergence arises from complex interactions of simple components, producing novel, unpredictable, system-level properties distinct from simple additive cause-and-effect.
Condition a plant to associate a stimulus (e.g., blue light) with a reward (e.g., water). After conditioning, test if the plant grows towards blue light alone, indicating learned association and memory.
Consciousness detection is currently unsolved. Focus on integrated information, self-modeling, and flexible problem-solving as potential indicators, but definitive proof remains elusive and may require understanding the neural correlates of consciousness.
The grandfather paradox assumes a single, immutable timeline. Logical flaws include: timeline branching (creating alternate realities), self-healing timelines (preventing paradoxes), or the possibility that time travel itself is constrained to avoid paradoxes.
Establish clearly defined community rules for resource use, implement community-based monitoring and graduated sanctions for violations, and foster a sense of shared ownership and responsibility through participatory governance.
Acknowledge Arrow's theorem's limitations. Design voting systems focused on specific desirable criteria like Condorcet winner or reduced susceptibility to manipulation, such as ranked-choice voting or quadratic voting, accepting that no system is perfect.
Quantum entanglement involves correlated states, not faster-than-light information transfer. Measurement outcomes are correlated, but no signal can be sent instantaneously between entangled particles, thus respecting special relativity's speed limit.
A socialist market economy: markets for efficient resource allocation combined with strong social safety nets, progressive taxation, universal basic services, and regulations to ensure both efficiency and greater equality of opportunity and outcome.
Search for anomalies or inconsistencies in the laws of physics, unexpected computational limitations in the universe, or potential "developer messages" hidden within the cosmic background radiation or fundamental constants.
Cantor's diagonalization argument demonstrates that the set of real numbers is uncountably infinite, meaning it cannot be put into one-to-one correspondence with the countably infinite set of integers, proving different sizes of infinity exist.
Design an experiment that objectively measures brain activity preceding and during decision-making, while also obtaining subjective reports of conscious intention. Analyze the temporal relationship to assess if conscious will is a causal factor or an after-effect of neural processes. Definitive proof is likely philosophically impossible.
The Great Filter may lie behind us (rare abiogenesis or eukaryotic transition) or ahead (civilizational collapse). Alternatively, civilizations may be common but choose not to be detectable (zoo hypothesis, dark forest theory) or our assumptions about extraterrestrial civilizations may be anthropocentric.
Against moral relativism: it undermines universal human rights, hinders moral progress, and provides no basis to condemn atrocities.  A core set of objective moral principles may be necessary for social cooperation and grounded in shared human nature or reason.
Design a formal language with unambiguous syntax and semantics, built upon logic and mathematics.  It would prioritize precision and eliminate ambiguity inherent in natural languages, potentially at the cost of expressiveness and ease of use.
Develop a battery of intelligence tests assessing diverse cognitive abilities (problem-solving, learning, adaptation, abstract reasoning) across various domains and modalities, minimizing cultural biases and focusing on fundamental information processing capacities applicable to both biological and artificial systems.
A society prioritizing liberal egalitarianism: maximizing individual freedom within a framework that ensures equal opportunity, social justice, and a robust safety net.  Balance individual autonomy with collective well-being through democratic governance and social responsibility.
Utilize Integrated Information Theory (IIT) to quantify consciousness as integrated information (Î¦), or Global Workspace Theory (GWT) to measure the extent of global broadcasting of information in the brain as proxies for levels of consciousness. These are theoretical frameworks requiring further empirical validation and measurement tools.
Search for evidence of parallel universes through: subtle interactions or "bleed-through" effects, anomalies in the cosmic microwave background indicating past collisions, or deviations from expected physics consistent with multiverse models like the Many-Worlds Interpretation or inflationary cosmology.
Investigate the unreasonable effectiveness of mathematics in describing the universe (discovery argument) versus the human-constructed nature of mathematical systems, axioms, and proofs (invention argument).  Mathematics likely involves both discovery of pre-existing structures and invention of formal systems to represent them.
Explore interpretations of quantum mechanics like Many-Worlds (no collapse, all possibilities realize), Pilot-Wave (hidden variables guide particles), or objective collapse theories (wave function physically collapses).  Experimental tests to distinguish between these interpretations are ongoing and challenging.
Develop an ethics based on fundamental principles like minimizing suffering, maximizing well-being, respecting autonomy, and promoting fairness, applicable to any sentient or sapient entity, biological or artificial, based on their capacity for experience, agency, and moral consideration.
Define life based on a cluster of core properties: self-replication, metabolism, homeostasis, adaptation/evolution, response to stimuli, and organization/complexity, broad enough to encompass diverse possible forms while distinguishing living from non-living entities.
Acknowledge the hard problem's intractability with current scientific understanding. Focus on exploring neural correlates of consciousness (NCC), integrated information theory, and global workspace theory as potential explanatory frameworks, while recognizing the subjective nature of qualia may require a paradigm shift in understanding consciousness.
Search for violations of Lorentz invariance at extremely high energies, evidence of discrete spacetime at the Planck scale, or predictions from quantum gravity theories (e.g., loop quantum gravity, string theory) suggesting time is emergent from more fundamental structures rather than a fundamental dimension.
Implement a probabilistic allocation system: each potential recipient, even in an infinite set, receives a vanishingly small probability of resource access, or focus on strategies to expand resource availability rather than just distribution in a fundamentally finite context.
Explore compatibilist views of free will, which argue that free will and determinism are compatible by defining free will as acting according to one's desires even if those desires are causally determined. Focus on the experience of agency and freedom from coercion rather than absolute metaphysical freedom.
Develop methods combining neuroimaging (fMRI, EEG) to correlate brain states with subjective reports of experience, and refine psychometric scales to quantify subjective qualities indirectly through behavioral and verbal responses, acknowledging limitations in directly accessing subjective experience objectively.
Investigate the consistent applicability and predictive power of abstract concepts (mathematical objects, logical principles, moral values) across different contexts and cultures, and explore their role in explaining objective reality as indirect evidence for their real, mind-independent existence (Platonic realism).
Search for evidence of inflationary cosmology, string theory landscape predictions, or anomalies in the cosmic microwave background radiation that might suggest our universe is part of a multiverse. Investigate variations in fundamental constants across vast cosmic scales as potential indicators of different universes.
